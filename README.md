- **Scroll-to-Section:** Smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section when a navigation link is clicked.
- **Active State Highlighting:** Highlights the section in view and its corresponding navigation link.
- **Back to Top Button:** A button that appears after scrolling down, allowing users to quickly return to the top of the page.
